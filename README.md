# <h1>Unreal Engine 5 Project: Obstacle Assault</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>This will be a 3rd Person Platformer style game in which the player has to avoid moving obstacles and reach a goal.</p>

<h2>Goals:</h2>
<p>
  The goal of this project is to learn Unreal 5 and Game Programming in C++.<br>
I will be making notes on the similarities between Unreal and Unity since I've been programming in Unity for 2 years.

<h2>Unity Counterparts in Unreal:</h2>

  -<b>BeginPlay()</b> is equivalent to the <b>Start()</b> method in Unity.<br>
-Tick is the same as Update in Unity.<br>
-UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) is like [SerializedField].<br>
-FVector is equivalent to Vector3 in Unity.
-DeltaTime is equivalent to Time.deltaTime.
</ul>
