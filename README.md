# Unreal Engine 5 Project: Obstacle Assault

Description:
This will be a 3rd Person Platformer style game in which the player has to avoid moving obstacles and reach a goal.

Goals:
The goal of this project is to learn Unreal 5 and Game Programming in C++.
I will be making notes on the similarities between Unreal and Unity since I've been programming in Unity for 2 years.
