# <h1>Unreal Engine 5 Project: Obstacle Assault</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>This will be a 3rd Person Platformer style game in which the player has to avoid moving obstacles and reach a goal.</p>

<h2>Goals:</h2>
<p>
  The goal of this project is to learn Unreal 5 and Game Programming in C++.<br>
I will be making notes on the similarities between Unreal and Unity since I've been programming in Unity for 2 years.
  </p>

<h2>Unity Counterparts in Unreal:</h2>
<ul>
<li> <b>BeginPlay()</b> is equivalent to the <b>Start()</b> method in Unity.
  <ul>
    <li>Everything in these methods is called when the game is started.
  </ul>
<li>Tick is the same as Update in Unity.
  <ul>
    <li>These methods run every frame.
  </ul>
<li>UPROPERTY() is like [SerializedField].
  <ul>
  	<li>Exposes a variable in the editor.
    	<li> UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) allows editing.
    	<li> UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere) only shows variable.
    	<li> UPROPERTY(Catergory = "Example") is like the [Header("Example"] attribute in Unity.
  </ul>
<li>FVector is equivalent to Vector3 in Unity.
  <ul>
    	<li>Structs consisting of 3 floats.
  </ul>
<li>DeltaTime is equivalent to Time.deltaTime.
</ul>
